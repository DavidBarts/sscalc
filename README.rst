sscalc: a SpreadSheet CALCulator
#################################

This program reads from standard input, which can be either whitespace-delimited
or in CSV form, turns any field that can be parsed as a number into a number,
then evaluates the passed expression as if it were an expression in a
spreadsheet. Calculations are performed using decimal arithmetic, not binary
floating point.

This is a stopgap README for use until a more comprehensive one can be
developed.
